Hey, thought I'd start documenting my origami ideas again in a place more accessible than my notebook. Maybe it'll hold me accountable to make nice crease patterns and write more coherent musings on design. Maybe someday this will inspire me to write a book. Any case, it's fun to update this HORRIFICly styled website. It's a throwback to high school me who had really good taste. </p>
